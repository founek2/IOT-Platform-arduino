# Arduino Client for MQTT

This library provides complex client for communication with [IoT Platform](https://prod.iotplatforma.cloud). You can specify all nodes and properties (including callback) and library will automaticly handle announcing and pairing with platform. MQTT communication is based on Homie convention.

## Compatible Hardware

The library uses the PubSubClient for interacting with the
MQTT. Curently are supported these boards:

-   ESP8266

Support for ESP32 might be easily added - I can`t test it now.
